# Psythereum

## Introduction
Psythereum is a platform where three kinds of people can help each other: people who need therapy, therapists who provide it, and researchers who want data. It's like a community where everyone works together. Patients get the help they need, therapists do their job, and researchers get information. This helps everyone involved.


## Problem Statement
Psythereum primarily addresses the challenges faced by researchers, while simultaneously tackling issues for all participant types. Patients seek anonymity and confidentiality, concerned about who can access their recordings, and they may feel insecure about meeting a psychiatrist in person. Psychiatrists encounter flexibility issues with working hours. Researchers lack access to authentic, consistent, and up-to-date data.


## Approach
To address the challenges faced by patients, therapists, and researchers, we propose building a secure and anonymous platform. This platform will enable users to have confidential sessions with their psychiatrists, with session recordings securely uploaded to a decentralized system. The recorded data will be fully encrypted, ensuring privacy and security. Researchers will have access to this anonymized and encrypted data, providing them with valuable insights for their studies.
