# Psythereum

## Introduction
Psythereum is a platform where three kinds of people can help each other: people who need therapy, therapists who provide it, and researchers who want data. It's like a community where everyone works together. Patients get the help they need, therapists do their job, and researchers get information. This helps everyone involved.
